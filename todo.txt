*BUGS*

-bots and players moves are not inserted correctly into db because of timing
-if you start game and reload without opponent than it doesnt work

*TODO*

FOR BOT:

-async play needs to set correct turn(always players turn on reload
-async play needs to populate the computer grid correctly on reload
-need to set the game to complete in the database



FOR GAME:
-add username of opponent 

-add status of opponent
